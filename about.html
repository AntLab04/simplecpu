<h3>About the website</h3>
Simple CPU was inspired by the success of the reddit comment I made 
<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2ax3k3/eli5_how_does_a_computer_actually_work_like_how/cizpwki"style="color: #0000AA">here.</a><br>
<br>
It was also inspired by my own frustrations trying to learn the basics of<br>
computer science. I wanted to give people a quick way to understand the <br>
basics, so that they could know what to look for. "I don't know what I <br>
dont know" is a common ailment for beginning programmers, this site is an <br>
attempt to address that.<br>
